# DrawYourOwnPinball

Draw your own pinball field and play it!

**Rules:**

- The ball is lost when it goes off screen.
- You have 999 lives.
- You can place the ball anywhere on the playing field.
- The flippers are controlled by the left and right mouse button.
- Follow the instruction in the console.
- Any bugs are features. 
- Press escape to exit at any points. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.

This was made for a course using OpenCV. The task was **"Make a pinball game playable by hands or keyboard."**. I took the liberty of also allowing a mouse as input.

**Warning**: This is not good code. It was supposed to to take ~4 hours, it took ~4 (sick) days.

_Notice: This is written in Python 3. If your distribution still defaults to Python 2, complain to the developers and use `python3`._
